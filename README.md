### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below: -->

While writing html I had to be careful while writing class names. In JSX it is usually written as className but in plain html it is just class. For example

```html
<h1 class="heading">Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
While defining height for an element we have to see what is its parents height. If its parents height is not defined. We have specify parents height before defining its childrens height.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
